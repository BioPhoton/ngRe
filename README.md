# Reactive Extensions for Angular
## Proposal for a fully reactive/zone-less architecture in Angular 


**This document is a proposal for a fully reactive architecture in Angular. 
Its main goal is to serve as the glue between your reactive code and the framework.**


Parts of Angular like the `ReactiveFormsModule`, `RouterModule`, `HttpClientModule` etc. are already reactive.
And especially when composing them together we see the benefit of observables. i.e. http composed with router params.
For those who prefer imperative code, it's little effort to restrict it to a single subscription.

On the other hand for those who prefer reactive code, it's not that easy. 
A lot of conveniences is missing, and beside the `async` pipe there is pretty much nothing there to take away the manual mapping to observables.  
Furthermore, an increasing number of packages start to be fully observable based. A very popular and widely used example is [ngRx](https://ngrx.io/). It enables us to maintain global push-based state management based on observables. 
Also, other well-known libraries, [angular material](https://material.angular.io/) provide a reactive way of usage.

This creates even more interest and for so-called `reactive primitives` for the Angular framework, like the `async` and other template syntax, decorators and services.
 
The first step would be to **give an overview** of the needs and a **suggested a set of extensions** to make it more convenient to **work in a reactive architecture**.
In the second step, We will show the best usage and common problems in a fully reactive architecture.

# Sections Important For Reactive Architecture

Here we will try to list all areas in angular where such helper primitives would be needed. 
The first step is to list all possible situations and a very simple solution for a reactive approach.
Each area may have different requirements to be more convenient to use reactively. 

Every section explains the current _imperative_ approach as well as the _reactive_ approach in a simple way.
This should help to understand the problems and get a good overview of the options and needs for a reactive architecture in angular.

Based on the collected information we can try to use the explored options to create an elegant solution for the explored needs.

Following topics are documented below:
- Dom-Elemet interaction
- Webcomponent interaction
- Component interaction

## DomElement

DomElements is everything you can query from `document`.

The goal is to list vanilla js versions as well as the angular way and list options on how to make property values and events working with angular.

### Send to property over `<elem attr=""></elem>`

To set a value for an input attribute you can query the dom get the item and set the value.

```typescript
const elem = document.getElementById('elem-1');
const elem.value = 42;        
```

This case is easy to cover in a general case as there are many 
built-in directives that enable us to set attributes on elements with angular.

**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <button id="p1" [disabled]="disabled">Btn</button>
  `
})
export class AppComponent  {
  disabled = false;
}
```

**Reactive approach:**

Angular provides a set of decorators for all standard dom attributes. 
This the suggested way to go and explained in detail in the AngularComponent section.  

**Reactive approach:**

```typescript
const elem = document.getElementById('elem-1');
fromEvent(elem, 'click')
  .subscribe(e => {
    console.log('click event:', e);
  });
``` 

**Needs:**   
As Angular covered this already this section can be ignored for the suggested extensions.

## WebComponent 

The goal is to list vanilla js versions as well as the angular way and list options on how to make property values and events working with angular.

### Send to property over `<elem attr=""></elem>`  

**Imperative approach:**
```typescript
TBD
```

**Reactive approach:**
```typescript
TBD
```

**Needs:**   
TBD

### Receive events over `elem.addEventListener()`

**Imperative approach:**
```typescript
TBD
```

**Reactive approach:**
```typescript
TBD
```

**Needs:**   
TBD

## Component/Directive

As the main requirement for a reactive architecture in current component-oriented 
frameworks are handling properties and events of components as well as several specifics for 
rendering and composition of observables.

In angular, we have an equivalent to properties and events, _input_ and _output_ bindings_.
But we also have several other options available to interact with components.

The goal is to list all features in angular that need a better integration. 
We cover an imperative as well as a reactive approach for each option.

We consider the following decorators:
- Input Decorator
- Output Decorator
- HostListener Decorator 
- HostBinding Decorator

And consider the following bindings:
- Input Binding
- Output Binding

### Input Decorator

Inside of a component or directive we can connect properties with the components in it bindings over the `@Input()` decorator.
This enables us to access the values of the incoming in the component. 

**_Receive property values over `@Input('state')`_**

**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>State: {{state | json}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  @Input() state;
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**

Here we have to consider to cache the latest value from state-input binding.
As changes fires before AfterViewInit, we normally would lose the first value sent. Using some caching mechanism prevents this.
Furthermore and most importantly **this makes it independent from the lifecycle hooks**.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>State: {{state$ | async | json}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  state$ = new ReplaySubject(1);
  @Input() 
  set state(v) {
      this.state$.next(v);
  };
}
``` 

**Needs:**   

Some decorator that **automates the boilerplate** of settings up the subject and connection it with the property.   
Here `ReplaySubject` is critical because of the life cycle hooks. 
`@Input` is fired first on `OnChange` where the first moment where the view is ready would be `AfterViewInit`

> **Boilerplate Automation**   
> For every binding following steps could be automated:
> - setting up a `Subject`
> - hooking into the `setter` of the input binding and `.next()` the incoming value

> **Early Producer**   
> All input bindings are so-called "early producer". A cache mechanism is needed as followed:
> - Use a `ReplaySubject` with `bufferSize` of `1` to emit notifications

--- 

### Output Decorator

**_Send event over `eventEmitter.emit(42)`_**

Inside of a component or directive, we can connect events with the components output bindings over the `@Output()` decorator.
This enables us to emit values to its parent component. 

**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<button (click)="onClick($event)">Btn</button>`
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  @Output()
  clickEmitter = new EventEmitter();
 
  onClick(e) {
    this.clickEmitter.next(e.timeStamp); 
  }
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**

Here we change 2 things.
We use a `Subject` to retrieve the button click event and 
**provide an observable instead of an EventEmitter for @Output()**.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<button (click)="clickEmitter.next($event)">Btn</button>`
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  btnClick = new Subject();
  
  @Output()
  clickEmitter = this.btnClick
    .pipe(
      map(e => e.timeStamp)
    );
}
```

**Needs:**   
No need for an extension.

> **No need for custom extensions**   
>  Due to the fact that we can also provide an `Observable` as `EventEmitters` there is **no need for as extension**


---   


### HostListener Decorator

**_Receive event from the host over `@HostListener('click', ['$event'])`_**

Inside of a component or directive, we can connect host events with a component method over the `@HostListener()` decorator.
This enables us to retrieve the host's events. 

**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>Num: {{num}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  num = 0;
  @HostListener('click', ['$event'])
  onClick(e) {
    this.num = ++this.num;
  }
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>Num: {{num$ | async}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  numSubj = new Subject();
  num$ = this.numSubj.pipe(scan(a => ++a));

  @HostListener('click', ['$event'])
  onCllick(e) {
    this.numSubj.next(e);
  }
}
```

**Needs:**   

We would need a decorator **automates the boilerplate** of the `Subject` creation and connect it with the property. 
As `subscriptions` can occur earlier than the `Host` could send a value we speak about "early subscribers". 
This problem can be solved as the subject is created in with instance construction.

> **Boilerplate Automation**   
> For every binding following steps could be automated:
> - setting up a `Subject`
> - hooking into the `setter` of the input binding and `.next()` the incoming value

> **Early Producer**   
> Make sure the created `Subject` it present early enough

---   

### HostBinding Decorator

**_Receive property changes from the host over `@HostBinding('class')`_**

Inside of a component or directive, we can connect the DOM attribute as from the host with the component property. 
Angular automatically updates the host element over change detection.
In this way, we can retrieve the host's properties changes.


**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>color: {{className}}</p>`,
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  className = 'visible';
  
  @HostBinding('class')
  get background() {
   return this.className;
  }
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**

```typescript
TBD
```

**Needs:**   

**Provide an observable** instead of a function.

Here again, we would need a decorator that **automates** the `Subject` creation and connection. 
As subscriptions can occur earlier than the `Host` could be ready we speak about "early subscribers". 
This problem can be solved as the subject is created in with instance construction.

> **Boilerplate Automation**   
> For every binding following steps could be automated:
> - setting up a `Subject`
> - hooking into the `setter` of the input binding and `.next()` the incoming value

> **Early Subscribers**   
> Make sure the created `Subject` it present early enough


---   


### Input Binding 

**_Send value changes to child compoent input `[state]="state"`_**

In the parent component, we can connect component properties to the child
component inputs over specific template syntax, the square brackets `[state]`.
Angular automatically updates the child component over change detection.
In this way, we can send component properties changes.

**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <app-child [state]="state"></app-child>
  `
})
export class AppComponent  {
  state = 42;
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**

Important to say is that with this case **we can ignore the life cycle hooks as the subscription happens always right in time**.
We cal rely on trust that subscription to `state$` happens after `AfterViewInit`.


> **Inconsistent handling of undefined variables**   
> It is important to mention the inconsistent handling of undefined variables and observables that didn't send a value yet. 

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <app-child [state]="state$ | async"></app-child>
  `
})
export class AppComponent  {
  state$ = of(42);
}
```

**Needs:**   
As we know exactly when changes happen we can trigger change detection manually. Knowing the advantages of subscriptions over the template and lifecycle hooks the solution should be similar to `async` pipe.

> **NgZone could be detached**   
> As all changes can get detected we could detach the pipe from the `ChangeDetection` and trigger it on every value change

> **Performance optimisations**
> - consider scheduling over `AnimationFrameScheduler` the output is always for the view

> **Implement strict and consistent handling of undefined for pipes**   
> A pipe similar to `async` that should act as follows:
> - when initially passed `undefined` the pipe should **forward `undefined`** as value as on value ever was emitted
> - when initially passed `null` the pipe should **forward `null`** as value as on value ever was emitted
> - when initially passed `of(undefined)` the pipe should **forward `undefined`** as value as `undefined` was emitted
> - when initially passed `of(null)` the pipe should **forward `null`** as value as `null` was emitted
> - when initially passed `EMPTY` the pipe should **forward `undefined`** as value as on value ever was emitted
> - when initially passed `NEVER` the pipe should **forward `undefined`** as value as on value ever was emitted
> - when reassigned a new `Observable` the pipe should **forward `undefined`** as value as no value was emitted from the new
> - when completed the pipe should **keep the last value** in the view until reassigned another observable
> - when sending a value the pipe should **forward the value** without changing it

### Template Bindings   
In the following, we try to explore the different needs when working with observables in the view.  

Lets examen different situations when binding observables to the view and see how the template syntax that Angular already provides solves this. Let's start with a simple example.

**Multiple usages of `async` pipe**
Here we have to use the `async` pipe twice. This leads to a polluted template and introduces another problem with subscriptions.
As observables are mostly unicasted we would receive 2 different values, one for each subscription.
This pushes more complexity into the component code because we have to make sure the observable is multicasted. 

```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    {{random$ | async}}
    <comp-b [value]="random$ | async">
    </comp-b>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  random$ = interval(1000)
    .pipe(
      map(_ => Math.random()),
      // needed to be multicasted
      share()
    );
}
```

**Binding over the `as` syntax**
To avoid such scenarios we could use the `as` syntax to bind the observable
to a variable and use this variable multiple times instead of using the `async` pipe multiple times.

```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngIf="random$ | async as random">
        {{random}}
        <comp-b [value]="random">
        </comp-b>
    </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  random$ = interval(1000)
    .pipe(
      map(_ => Math.random())
    );
}
```

**Binding over the `let` syntax**
Another way to avoid multiple usages of the `async` pipe is the `let` syntax to bind the observable to a variable.

```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngIf="random$ | async; let random = ngIf">
        {{random}}
        <comp-b [value]="random">
        </comp-b>
    </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  random$ = interval(1000)
    .pipe(
      map(_ => Math.random())
    );
}
```

Both ways misuse the `*ngIf` directive to introduce a context variable and not to display or hide a part of the template.
This comes with several downsides:
- **we lose the meaning** of the `*ngIf` directive 
- the functionality of hiding displaying itself.
  **The `*ngIf` directive is triggered be falsy values**, but we don't want to conditionally show or hiding content, 
  but just introduce a context variable. This could lead to problems in several situations. 
- The functionality of **subscribing has to be done separately over the `async` pipe**  

**`*ngIf` directive triggered by falsy values**
```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngIf="random$ | async as random">
        {{random}}
        <comp-b [value]="random">
        </comp-b>
    </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  random$ = interval(1000)
    .pipe(
      map(_ => Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : 0)
    );
}
```

As we can see, in this example the `ng-container` would only be visible if the value is `1` and therefore `truthy`. 
All `falsy` values like `0` would be hidden. This is a problem in some situations. 

We could try to use `*ngFor` to avoid this.

**Context variable over the `*ngFor` directive**
```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <ng-container *ngFor="let random of [random$ | async]">
        {{random}}
        <comp-b [value]="random">
        </comp-b>
    </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  random$ = interval(1000)
    .pipe(
      map(_ => Math.random() > 0.5 ? 1 : 0)
    );
}
```

By using `*ngFor` to create a context variable we avoid the problem with `*ngIf` and `falsy` values.
But we still **misuse a directive**. Additionally `*ngFor` is less performant than `*ngIf`.   

**Nested `ng-container` problem**

```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
  <ng-container *ngIf="observable1$ | async as color">
    <ng-container *ngIf="observable2$ | async as shape">
      <ng-container *ngIf="observable3$ | async as name">
        {{color}}-{{shape}}-{{name}}
        <app-color [color]="color" [shape]="shape" [name]="name">
        </app-color>
       </ng-container>
     <ng-container>
  </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  observable1$ = interval(1000);
  observable2$ = interval(1500);
  observable3$ = interval(2000);
}
```

Here we nest `ng-container` which is a useless template code.
A solution could be to compose an object out of the individual observables.
This can be done in the view or the component.

**Composing Object in the View**

```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
  <ng-container
    *ngIf="{
      color: observable1$ | async,
      shape: observable2$ | async,
      name:  observable3$ | async
    } as c">
    {{color}}-{{shape}}-{{name}}
    <app-other-thing [color]="c.color" [shape]="c.shape" [name]="c.name">
    </app-other-thing>
  </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  observable1$ = interval(1000);
  observable2$ = interval(1500);
  observable3$ = interval(2000);
}
```

Here we can use `*ngIf` again because and object is always `truthy`. However, the downside here is
we have to use the `async` pipe for each observable. `Furthermore we have less control over the single observables. 
A better way would be to **move the composition into the template** and only export final compositions to the template.

**Composition in the Component**
```html
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
  <ng-container *ngIf="composition$ | async as c">
    {{color}}-{{shape}}-{{name}}
    <app-color [color]="c.color" [shape]="c.shape" [name]="c.name">
    </app-color>
  </ng-container>
  `})
export class AppComponent  {
  observable1$ = interval(1000);
  observable2$ = interval(1500);
  observable3$ = interval(2000);

  composition$ = combineLatest(
    this.observable1$.pipe(startWith(null), distinctUntilChanged()),
    this.observable2$.pipe(startWith(null), distinctUntilChanged()),
    this.observable3$.pipe(startWith(null), distinctUntilChanged()),
    (color, shape, name) => ({color, shape, name})
  )
  .pipe(
    share()
  );

}
```
As we see in this example in the component we have full control over the composition. 


**Needs:**   
We need **a directive** that just **defines a context variable** without any interaction of the actual dom structure.
The **syntax should be simple and short** like the `as` syntax. It should take over basic performance optimizations.
Also, the **consistent handling of null and undefined** should be handled.

> **Implement more convenient binding syntax**   
> To improve usability we should fulfill the following:
> - the context should be always present. `*ngIf="{}"` would do that already
> - avoid multiple usages of the `async pipe
> - move subscription handling in the directive
> - better control over the context. Maybe we could get rid of the `as` as variable??
> - implement an internal layer to handle null vs undefined etc
> - implement the option to put additional logic for complete and error of an observable

> **Basic performance optimisations**
> - consider scheduling over `AnimationFrameScheduler` the output is always for the view
> - handling changes could be done programmatically. Good for running zone-less
 
> **Implement strict and consistent handling of null/undefined for the bound value**    
> Please visit the section [Input Binding](Input-Binding) for a full list of requirements

### Output Binding 

**_Receive events from child component over `(stateChange)="fn($event)"`_**

In the parent component, we can receive events from child components over specific template syntax, the round brackets `(stateChange)`.
Angular automatically updates fires the provides function over change detection.
In this way, we can receive component events.

**Imperative approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    state: {{state}}
    <app-child (stateChange)="onStateChange($event)"></app-child>
  `
})
export class AppComponent  {
  state;
  onStateChange(e) {
    this.state = e; 
  }
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    state: {{state$ | async}}<br>
    <app-child (stateChange)="state$.next($event)"></app-child>
  `
})
export class AppComponent  {
  state$ = new Subject();
}
```

**Needs:**    
As it is minimal overhead we can stick with creating a `Subject` on our own.

> **No need for custom extensions**   
>  Due to the fact of the minimal overhead and the resources of creating a custom `Decorator` for it there **no need for as extension**

---   

### Component and Directive Life Cycle Hooks

As the component's logic can partially rely on the components life cycle hooks we also need to consider the in-out evaluation. 

Angular fires a variety of lifecycle hooks. Some of them a single time some of them only once a components lifetime.

Angulars life cycle hooks are listed ere in order:   
(Here the Interface name is used. The implemented method starts with the prefix 'ng')
- OnChanges (ongoing, transports changes)
- OnInit (single shot)
- DoCheck (ongoing)
- AfterContentInit (single shot)
- AfterContentChecked (ongoing)
- AfterViewInit (single shot)
- AfterViewChecked (ongoing)
- OnDestroy (single shot)

The goal here is to find a unified way to have single shot, as well as ongoing life cycle hooks, and observable.

**Imperative approach:**   

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>change: {{changes | json}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
   @Input()
   state;

   changes;

  ngOnChanges(changes) {
    this.changes= changes;
  }
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**   
As above mentioned in section Input Decorator we **replay the latest value to avoid timing issues** related to life cycle hooks.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>change: {{changes$ | async | json}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() state;
   
  onChanges$ = new ReplaySubject(1);
   
  changes$ = this.onChanges$
      .pipe(map(changes => changes));

  ngOnChanges(changes) {
    this.onChanges$.next(changes);
  }
}
```

**Handle general things for hooks:**   

Following things need to be done for every lifecycle hook:
- every life cycle replays the last value and completion
- errors are swallowed and complete is returned instead
- every hook should be tied to the lifecycle of the component

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>change: {{changes$ | async | json}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() state;
   
  onDestroy$$ = new ReplaySubject(1);
  onDestroy$ = this.onDestroy$$.pipe(catchError(e => EMPTY));
  
  onChanges$$ = new ReplaySubject(1);
  onChanges$ = this.onChanges$$.pipe(catchError(e => EMPTY), takeUntil(this.onDestroy$));
  
   
  ngOnChanges(changes) {
    this.onChanges$.next(changes);
  }
  
  ngOnDestroy(changes) {
    this.onDestroy$.next(changes);
  }
}
```

**Handle hook specific stuff:**   

To handle the differences in lifecycle hooks we follow the following rules:
- single shot life cycle hooks complete after their first emission
- single shot life cycle hooks swallow errors and emit the last void
- on-going life cycle hooks just complete on error

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>change: {{changes$ | async | json}}</p>`
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() state;
  
  const singleShotOperators = pipe(
    take(1),
    catchError(e => of(void)),
    takeUntil(this.onDestroy$)
  );
  const ongoingOperators = pipe(
    catchError(e => EMPTY),
    takeUntil(this.onDestroy$)
  );
  
  onChanges$ = this.onChanges$$.pipe(this.ongoingOperators);
  onInit$ = this.onInit$$.pipe(this.singleShotOperators);
  doCheck$ = this.doCheck$$.pipe(this.ongoingOperators);
  afterContentInit$ = this.afterContentInit$$.pipe(this.singleShotOperators);
  afterContentChecked$ = this.afterContentChecked$$.pipe(this.ongoingOperators);
  afterViewInit$ = this.afterViewInit$$.pipe(this.singleShotOperators);
  afterViewChecked$ = this.afterViewChecked$$.pipe(this.ongoingOperators);
  onDestroy$ = this.onDestroy$$.pipe(take(1));
   
  ngOnChanges(changes) {
    this.onChanges$.next(changes);
  }
  
  ngOnDestroy(changes) {
    this.onDestroy$.next(changes);
  }
}
```


**Needs**   
We need a decorator to **automates the boilerplate** of the `Subject` creation and connect it with the property away. 

Also `subscriptions` can occur earlier than the `Host` could send a value we speak about "early subscribers". 
This problem can be solved as the subject is created in with instance construction.

> **Boilerplate Automation**   
> For every binding following steps could be automated:
> - setting up a `Subject`
> - hooking into the `setter` of the input binding and `.next()` the incoming value
> - hiding observer methods form external usage

> **Respect Lifetime and State of Lifecycles**   
> - subscription handling tied to component lifetime
> - single shot observables complete after their first call

> **Late Subscribers**   
> - As subscriptions could happen before values are present (subscribing to `OnInit` in the constructor) 
>   we have to make sure the Subject is created early enough for all life cycle hooks
> - on subscription to already completed observable of a lifecycle it should return the last event and complete again. 

---   

### Service Life Cycle Hooks

In general, services are global or even when lazy-loaded the are not unregistered at some point in time.
The only exception is Services in the `Components` `providers` 
Their parts of the services logic could rely on the life of the service, which is exactly the lifetime of the component. 

Angular for such scenarios angular provides the `OnDestroy` life cycle hook for classes decorated with `@Injectable`.

The goal here is to find a unified way to have the services `OnDestroy` life cycle hooks as observable.

**Imperative approach:**   

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: ``,
  providers: [LocalProvidedService]
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  constructor(private s: LocalProvidedService) {
  }
}

export class LocalProvidedService implements OnDestroy {
  
  constructor() {
  }

  ngOnDestroy(changes) {
    console.log('LocalProvidedService OnDestroy');
  }
}
``` 

**Reactive approach:**   

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: ``,
  providers: [LocalProvidedService]
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  constructor(private s: LocalProvidedService) {
  }
}
@Injctable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class LocalProvidedService implements OnDestroy {
  onDestroy$ = new Subject();
   
  constructor() {
     this.onDestroy$subscribe(_ => console.log('LocalProvidedService OnDestroy');)
  }

  ngOnDestroy(changes) {
    this.onDestroy$.next();
  }
}
```

**Needs**   
We need a decorator to **automates the boilerplate** of the `Subject` creation and connect it with the property away. 

> **Boilerplate Automation**   
> For every binding following steps could be automated:
> - setting up a `Subject`
> - hooking into the `setter` of the input binding and `.next()` the incoming value
> - we should NOT override but EXTEND the potentially already existing functions

---   

## Local State

### Encapsulation and Instantiation

The goal here is to evaluate approaches of encapsulating state-management into a service. 
As this is trivial in angular we directly go to the example.

**Simple approach:**   

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: ``,
  providers: [LocalProvidedService]
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  constructor(private localStateService: LocalStateService) {
    this.localStateService.next(42);
  }
}

@Injctable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class LocalProvidedService implements OnDestroy {
  subject = new Subject();
  
  next(value) {
    this.subject.next(value);
  }
}
```

**Needs**   
As Angular already provides a DI layer there is nothing to solve here

---   

### Managing the State Structure

The goal here is to come up with a good slim solution for managing the components state as an object.
The state should be immutable by default and easy to change and receive changes.

**Simple approach:**   

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `
    <button (click)="increment()">click</button>
    state: {{state$ | async | json}}
  `
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  command$ = Subject();
  
  state$ = this.command$
    .pipe(
      scan((state, command) => ({...state, ...command}), {})
    );

  increment() {
    this.command$.next({value: 1})  
  } 
}
```

**Needs**   
We need to manage the components state as an object. The logic should make immutable changes so we don't have care about it.
The state should be easy to receive and change to the state should be able with as minimal code as possible.

> **Manage state as an object**  
> Form the above explorations following things are needed to organize our state
> - an object to identify every stored value over a key
> - setup a `Subject` to have the observers `.next()` Method available to send values
> - accumulate the values in an object over the `scan` operator
> - at least immutable changes to the shallow 
>   done by i.e. the TypeScript spread operator `...` should be automated by the logic
> - having a layer of validation for the commands

---   

### Late Subscriber

Situations, where interested parties join a part of your application later on in time, are called late subscribers. 
Some meaningful examples could be:
- the view is a late subscriber to stuff happening in the `constructor` or the `ngOnChanges` method.
- any component is a late subscriber to a stateful service

Such situations are handled over getter in imperative programming. In reactive programming, we solve this over thin caching layer.

**Problem of being too late**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-late-subscriber',
  template: `
    <h2>Late Subscriber Child</h2>
    {{state$ | async | json}}
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent {
  state$ = new Subject();
  
  @Input()
  set state(v) {
    this.state$.next(v);
  }

}
```

**Replaying latest (n) values**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-late-subscriber',
  template: `
    <h2>Late Subscriber Child</h2>
    {{state$ | async | json}}
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent {
  state$ = new ReplaySubject(1);
  
  @Input()
  set state(v) {
    this.state$.next(v);
  }
}
```

**Needs**   

We need to abstract timing issues away from the consumer. In the case of late subscribers, it is easily possible with subjects like `BehaviorSubject` or `ReplaySubject` or operators like `share` or `shareReplay`.


> **Replaying latest Values**
> - use `ReplaySubject` to cache the latest (n) values. In most of the cases, this is the way to go.
> - there are rare cases where we want to use an initial value and are not able to use `startWith`, here a `BehaviorSubject` can be used 
> - In cases where we have no control of the source we can also use `shareReplay`
> - In stateful services the replayed values are always limited to `1`. The actual value and all future ones.

--- 

### Sharing References over Observables

There are situations where we have to compose multiple streams, compute new state and create a reference to some object, i.e. a `FromGroup`. This reference is then later on shared with multiple subscribers.

Such situations are handled by mutation a component property in imperative programming. 
In reactive programming, we solve this multi-casting.

**Problem of being shared references**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-sharing-a-reference',
  template: `
    <h2>Sharing a reference</h2>
    <p><b>default$:</b></p>
    <form *ngIf="(formGroup$ | async$) as formGroup" [formGroup]="formGroup">
      <div *ngFor="let c of formGroup.controls | keyvalue">
        <label>{{c.key}}</label>
        <input [formControlName]="c.key"/>
      </div>
    </form>
  `
})
export class SharingAReferenceComponent {
  state$ = new ReplaySubject(1);
  @Input()
  set formGroupModel(value) {
    this.state$.next(value);
  }

  @Output() formValueChange = new EventEmitter();

  formGroup$: Observable<FormGroup> = combineLatest(this.state$, this.router.params)
    .pipe(
      map(this.preparingFormGroupConfig),
      map(config => this.fb.group(config))
    );
    
  constructor(
    private fb: FormBuilder,
    private router: ActivatedRoute
  ) {
    this.formGroup$
      .pipe(
        switchMap((fg: FormGroup) => fg.valueChanges)
      )
      .subscribe(v => this.formValueChange.emit(v));
  }

  preparingFormGroupConfig([modelFromInput, modelFromRouterParams]) {
    // override defaults with router params if exist
    return Object.entries({...modelFromInput, ...modelFromRouterParams})
      .reduce((c, [name, initialValue]) => ({...c, [name]: [initialValue]}), {});
  }

}
```

As we see the provided example is not working. The reason for this is we subscribe multiple times to the `formGroup$`.
One time in the template to render the form, the second time in the constructor to forward form value changes to the `EventEmitter`.
Because the `formGroup$` observable is cold (every subscriber receives a unique producer) we instantiate the `FormGroup` once per subscription.
 
**Multicast the reference problem**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-sharing-a-reference',
  template: `
    <h2>Sharing a reference</h2>
    <p><b>newObject$:</b></p>
    <div>
      {{newObject$ | async | json}}
    </div>
  `
})
export class SharingAReferenceComponent {
  newObject$ = of(Math.random());
    
  constructor() {
    this.newObject$
      .subscribe(console.log);
  }

}
```

As we see we end up with 2 different numbers. 


**Multicast the reference solution**

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-sharing-a-reference',
  template: `
    <h2>Sharing a reference</h2>
    <p><b>newObject$:</b></p>
    <div>
      {{newObject$ | async | json}}
    </div>
  `
})
export class SharingAReferenceComponent {
  newObject$ = of(Math.random())
    .pipe(share());
    
  constructor() {
    this.newObject$
      .subscribe(console.log);
  }

}
```

Here we use `shareReplay(1)` to make sure all subscriber receives the same reference.

**Needs**   

To be able to share references creates on the flyover observables we have to make sure the observables are multicasted.


> **Sharing a reference over observables**
> - use `shareReplay(1)` make sure all subscribers receive the same reference
> - forward last instance for a late subscriber. Also done with `shareReplay(1)`

--- 

### Early Producer

Situations, where we have early producers, are things where we have values produces and transported over _cold_ Observables. In this case, as we have no subscriber yet on the mentioned Observable, we are losing all values until the first subscriber. 

The goal would be to find a solution that can get encapsulated and abstracted away from the actual code.

**Problem of early production**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-early-producer',
  template: `
    {{state$ | async | json}}
  `
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent {
  command$ = new Subject();
  state$ = this.command
    .pipe(
      scan((s,c)=>({...s,...c}), {})
    );
  
  @Input()
  set state(v) {
    this.command$.next(v);
  }
  
  constructor() {
    this.state = {slice1: 7};
    this.state = {slice2: 42};
  }
}
```

**Making the accumulation hot**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-late-subscriber',
  template: `
    <h2>Late Subscriber Child</h2>
    {{state$ | async | json}}
  `,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent {
  command$ = new Subject();
  state$ = this.command
    .pipe(
      scan( (s,c) => ({...s,...c}), {} ),
      publish()
    );
  
  @Input()
  set state(v) {
    this.command$.next(v);
  }
  
  constructor() {
    this.state.connect();

    this.state = { slice1: 7 };
    this.state = { slice2: 42 };
  }
}
```
**Needs**   
We need to have the observable to be hot with component constructor. Additional pipes or similar should be abstractedd away.

> **Providing State as Hot**
> To ensure all values get processed we need to:
> - call the `.connect()` on the observable created over `publish` at component construction
> - use `publishReplay(1)` to provide state for late subcriber

---

### Subscription handling

Normally we use the component's lifecycle to subscribe and unsubscribe from certain observables in the component.
We already know some solutions for getting a clean and elegant subscription handling by turning OnDestroy into an Observable. 
But it still feels a bit repetitive. Furthermore, it is up to the user to do subscription handling right.
 
The goal would be to find a way to move subscription handling outside of the component code.

**Subscription Handling Inside of Component**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-early-producer',
  template: ``
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent {
  ngOnDestroy$ = new Subject();
  command$ = new Subject();
  state$ = this.command
    .pipe(
      scan( (s,c) => ({...s,...c}), {} ),
      publish()
    );
  
  constructor() {
    this.state$
    .pipe(takeUntil(this.ngOnDestroy$))
    .subscribe(console.log);
  }
  
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.ngOnDestroy$.next();
  }
  
}
```

**Subscription Handling over View Provider**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-early-producer',
  template: ``,
  providers: [LocalStateService]
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent implements OnDestroy {
   
  constructor(private localState: LocalStateService) {
    this.localState.state$
    .subscribe(console.log);
  }
 
}

class LocalStateService implements OnDestroy {
   ngOnDestroy$ = new Subject();
   
   command$ = new Subject();
   state$ = this.command
    .pipe(
      scan( (s,c) => ({...s,...c}), {} ),
      publish()
    );
  
    ngOnDestroy() {
      this.ngOnDestroy$.next();
    }
}
```

**Needs**   
We need to find an elegant way of controlling subscriptions in a component.

> **Automated subscription handling**
> To ensure all subscriptions are cleaned up outside ou the component we need to:
> - encapsulate state managed in the component into a service 
> - leverage the services `OnDestroy` life cycle hook to handle subscription inside the service
> - provide it under the component's providers to bind its lifetime to the components lifetime
> - use dependency injection us instantiate the service with component construction

TBD

# General Overview of Explored Problems

## General Timing Issues

As a lot of problems are related to timing issues this section is here to give a comülete overview of all the different types of issues. 

Two different problems are occurring in multiple different situations:
- Late Subscriber Problem
- Early Producer Problem

### The Late Subscriber Problem

Incoming values arrive before the subscription has happened.

For example state over `@Input()` decorators arrives before the view gets rendered and a used pipe could receive the value.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-late-subscriber',
  template: `
    {{state$ | async | json}}
  `
})
export class LateSubscriberComponent {
  state$ = new Subject();
  
  @Input()
  set state(v) {
    this.state$.next(v);
  }

}
```

We call this situation late subscriber problem. In this case, the view is a late subscribe to the values from '@Input()' properties.
There are several situations from our previous explorations that have this problem:
- [Input Decorators](Input-Decorators)
  - transporting values from `@Input` to `AfterViewInit` hook
  - transporting values from `@Input` to the view
  - transporting values from `@Input` to the constructor 
- [Component And Directive Life Cycle Hooks](Component-And-Directive-Life-Cycle-Hooks)
  - transporting `OnChanges` to the view
  - getting the state of any life cycle hook later in time (important when hooks are composed)
- [Local State](Local-State)
  - transporting the current local state to the view
  - getting the current local state for other compositions

**Solutions**

All those problems boil down to 2 different solutions depending on the particular problem.
- using `ReplaySubjects` with `bufferSize` of `1` to cache the latest sent value
- using `shareReplay` for referential sharing as shown in [Sharing References over Observables](Sharing-References-over-Observables)


### The Early Producer Problem

The subscription happens before any value can arrive.

For example, subscriptions to view elements the constructor happen before they ever exist.
We call this situation early subscriber problem. In this case, the component constructor is an early subscribe to the events from '(click)' bindings. 

All above decorators should rely on a generic way of wrapping a function or property as well as a way
to configure the used Subject for multi-casting similar to [multicast](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/a9fa9d421d69e6e07aec0fa835b273283f8a034c/src/internal/operators/multicast.ts#L34)

In this way, it is easy to have a simplified public API but flexibility internally.

**Decorators that:**
- rely on configurable multi-casting similar to `multicast` operator.
  this provides a generic configurable way for all cases 
---

## Sharing references 

TBD

## Convenient Way To Wire Things Together
As discussed in [Automate boilerplate](#Automoate-boilerplate) a lot of things that are related to angular can be solved by the right decorator. But there are other areas where we need to provide some solutions. A more general one than just life cycle hooks of a single component. 

The problem of connecting all component bindings, global state, locally provided services, view events and 
The main reason here is getting the values over View elements that are instantiated later.

TBD



## Automate Boilerplate

Automate boilerplate of setting up a subject and connecting it to a producer.

Here a configuration method for the type of `Subject` similar to the one from [multicast](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/a9fa9d421d69e6e07aec0fa835b273283f8a034c/src/internal/operators/multicast.ts#L34) would be nice.

In a majority of the cases, there was a need for abstracting away the boilerplate of setting up a subject and connecting it to the producer. A normal `Subject` was used in most of the cases. Some cases used a `ReplaySunject` or `BeHaviorSubject` to initialize the value. This was used to provide the latest value for a new subscriber. 

Here we think one or many component property/method decorator can help. 

**Decorators that:**
- automatically use the right caching strategy i.e. replay
- getter is hot by after the decorator fires i.e. subscription possible without considering life cycle hooks
- setter accepts observables as values i.e. connecting a reactive radio group directly to a style property 

---

## Intuitive Way To Handle Timing Issues

# Suggested Extensions

Based on the above listing and their needs we suggest a set of Angular extensions that should make it easier to set up a fully reactive architecture.

Extensions suggested:
- Push Pipe
- Multi Let Structural Directive
- Observable Life Cycle Hooks
  - selectChange RxJS Operator
- Observable Input Bindings
- Observable Output Bindings
- Observable Host Bindings
- Observable Host Listener
- Observable ViewChild/Children
- Observable ContentChild/Children
- Local State Management
  - selectSlices RxJS Operator
  - 

## Push Pipe

An angular pipe similar to the `async` pipe but triggers `detectChanges` instead of `markForCheck`.
This is required to run zone-less. We render on every pushed message.
(currently, there is an [isssue](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/31438) with the `ChangeDetectorRef` in ivy so we have to wait for the fix.

The pipe should work as template binding `{{thing$ | push}}` 
as well as input binding `[color]="thing$ | push"` and trigger the changes of the host component.

```html
<div *ngIf="(thing$ | push) as thing">
  color: {{thing.color}}
  shape: {{thing.shape}}
<div>

<app-color [color]="(thing$ | push).color">
</app-color>
```

**Included Features:**
- subscription handling overview  life cycle
- a unified way of handling null and undefined with streams
- optional flag to turn off scheduling over `AnimationFrameScheduler` (on by default)
- change detection is done manually which allows it to work zone-less too

## Let Structural Directive

The `*let` directive serves a convenient way of binding multiple observables in the same view context.
It also helps with several default processing under the hood.

The current way of handling subscriptions in the view looks like that:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="observable1$ | async as c">
  <app-color [color]="c.color" [shape]="c.shape" [name]="c.name">
  </app-color>  
</ng-container>
```

The `*let` directive take over several things and makes it more convenient and save to work with streams in the template
`*let="{o: o$, t: t$} as s;"` 

```html
<!-- observables = { color: observable1$, shape: observable2$, name:  observable3$ } -->

<ng-container *let="observable as c">
  <app-color [color]="c.color" [shape]="c.shape" [name]="c.name">
  </app-color>
</ng-container>

<ng-container *let="observable; let c">
  <app-color [color]="c.color" [shape]="c.shape" [name]="c.name">
  </app-color>
</ng-container>

<ng-container *let="observable; color as c; shape as s; name as n">
  <app-color [color]="c" [shape]="s" [name]="n">
  </app-color>
</ng-container>
```

**Included Features:**
- binding is always present. (`*ngIf="{}"` normally effects it)
- it takes away the multiple usages of the `async` pipe 
- propper handling of null and undefined values
- removes state slices if bound observable completes or errors
- an option to disable scheduling over `AnimationFrameScheduler` (on by default)
- control change detection and therefore can run zone-less

## Observable Life Cycle Hooks

A property decorator which turns a lifecycle method into an observable and assigns it to the related property.

The decorator should work as a proxy for all life cycle hooks ` @hook$('onInit') onInit$;` 
as well as forward passed values i.e. `changes` in from the `OnChanges` hook.

```typescript
  @hook$('onInit') onInit$;
  @hook$('onDestroy') onDestroy$;

  this.onInit$
    .pipe(
      switchMapTo(interval(1000)),
      map(_ => Date.now()),
      takeUntil(this.onDestroy$)
    )
    .subscribe();
```

**Included Features**
- it handles late subscribers.
- exposes only observables
- respects single shot vs ongoing life cycles
- subscription handling over the component lifetime
- return the latest value when resubscribing

### selectChanges RxJS Operator


An operators `selectChanges` to select one or many specific slices from `SimpleChange`. 
This operator can be used in combination with `onChanges$`.

It also provides a very early option to control the forwarded values.

**Example of selectSlice operator**
```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  @hook$('onChanges') 
  onChanges$: Observable<SimpleChanges>;

  @Input() state;
  state$ = this.onChanges$.pipe(getChange('state'));
}
```

Following things are done under the hood:
- pull out `currentValue` from `SimpleChanges` object
- optional it could have a parma for a custom comparison function

## Observable Input Bindings

A property decorator which turns component or directive input binding into an observable and assigned it to the related property.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<p>input: {{input$ | async}}</p>`,
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  @Input$()
  input$;
}
```

Following things are done under the hood:
- It caches to consider late subscribers (life cycle hook related) 
- It is multicasted to avoid multiple subscriptions
- It works with WebComponents and AngularComponents

## Observable Output Bindings

A property decorator which turns a view event into an observable and assigns it to the related property.

The solution should work do most of his work in the component itself. 
Only a small piece in the template should be needed to link the view with the component property.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<button #elem">clicks: {{count$ | async}}</button>`,
})
export class ChildComponent  {
  @FromView$('#elem', 'click')
  click$;
  
  count$ = this.click$.pipe(scan(a => ++a, 0));
}
```

Following things are done under the hood:
- It makes it possible to subscribe to the property even before the view is rendered 
- It is multicasted to avoid multiple subscriptions
- It works with DomElements, WebComponents, and AngularComponents

Here a link to a similar already existing ideas from [@elmd_](https://twitter.com/elmd_):
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typebytes/ngx-template-streams

## Local State Management

This extension is maybe the most interesting one. While we can 

A tiny logic that combines:
- values over input bindings
- The component class internal state
- state rendered to view 
- state from services.

A way to connect events from the view and component as observable.

```typescript
constructor(private lS: LocalState<MyState>) {
  this.lS
    .connectSlice('num', interval(1000));
  this.lS
    .connectSlice('isNew', this.isNew$);
  this.lS
    .connectSlice('buttons', this.buttons$);
}
```

### selectSlices RxJS Operator

A flexible way to query one or many state slices.
It considers also a late subscriber. 

An operators `selectSlice` to select a specific slice from the managed state. 
This operator can be used to get slices from `this.lS$`.

```typescript
